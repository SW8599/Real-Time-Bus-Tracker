# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This project shows the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. Made using html javascript, css, and mapbox. Watch as it moves through the streets.

All you need to do is click the button that says "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" and it will begin.

I plan on changing where it goes and making it so the bus tracker is being followed by the screen camera.
